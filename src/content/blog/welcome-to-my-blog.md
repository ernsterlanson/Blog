# Welcome to My Blog

Welcome to my new blog! This post will demonstrate various markdown features that you can use in your own blog posts.

## Text Formatting

You can write paragraphs naturally, and use various text formatting options:

- **Bold text** is created with double asterisks
- *Italic text* uses single asterisks
- `Code snippets` use backticks
- [Links](https://example.com) are created with brackets and parentheses

## Code Blocks

You can share code blocks with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists
- First item
- Second item
- Third item with a sub-list:
  - Sub-item 1
  - Sub-item 2

### Ordered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Quotes

You can include quotes:

> The best way to predict the future is to invent it.
> - Alan Kay

## Images

## Tables

You can create tables:

| Feature | Description | Support |

- title: The post title
