Currently I am working on my newly started piano trio EET. My vision for this trio is to create long form jazz music. I love jazz, but I don't want to play the kind that has a predictable form such as theme-solo-solo-theme. I am writing music for the trio using forms from classical music such as sonata-form, rondo, and tertiary form, where the transitions between sections incorporate most of the improvisation.
