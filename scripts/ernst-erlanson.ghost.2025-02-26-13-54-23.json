He refers to the common-sense idea that we gain knowledge about the world through opening our senses and recieving it. Filling up our buckets so to speak. This idea is false, and the contrasting view “the searchlight” describes what is really going on. Essentially gaining knowledge is something active, we encounter problems and guess the solutions, eliminate the ideas that does not work until we get to an idea that works. By doing that we are creating knowledge about the world.\n\nIn education “the bucket” can be seen in the fact that the underlying assumption of school is to carve out a piece of valuable knowledge from our tradition and pass it on to the students. Knowledge is something that is present in the minds of the educators and the students are thought to be the recievers of this knowledge. The comedian Louis CK describes it thus:\n\n-Hi what is my job?\n\n- Here’s what we need you to do, we need you to make children know maths\n\n- Wow, do they wanna know math?\n\n- No they don’t wanna know it.\n\nAdmittedly Louis makes it a bit tendentious for comedic purposes, nevertheless, the situation is more or less what he describes. It is a picture of taking a group of young people and making them know things, in a way similar to how you would program a computer to do certain things. The system's success is measured based on how well the teachers have made them know maths, or other subjects.\n\nI describe it as “regurgitation over problem-solving”. I want to use learning about democracy as an example of the problems that are caused by this.\n\n\nLearning about democracy\n\nIn Sweden learning about democracy is mandatory in school. The purpose of this is to make the children into peaceful democratic citizens. One thing to be noted, lest I am sounding all to negative, this is working!

This is open to anyone. All you need is 30 minutes (or whatever one can manage) to sit down and write.\n\nThat would be the job\n\n\n2. Doing the actual stuff\n\nWhen doing this thing, check how I like it.\n\nThose 30 minutes that I take to write, do I look forward to it? If those 30 minutes are the prime time of the day, the time when I feel that things are flowing, then that is a good sign. But if I don't like it, that means there is something wrong with my dream. Does not mean necessarily that the whole dream is wrong, might be something with how I approach writing.\n\nThe basic thing is though, if you want to be a writer, you have to like the act of writing.\n\n\n3. Ignoring outcomes\n\nIf my dream is dependent on being successful, it's a bad dream.\n\nIt is good to aim high, but there is no way to know in advance if I am right. I can’t know if what I am doing will be successful. And even if I am successful, I still have to write. But, If I already like to write I will win no matter what, because the reward is all about doing the job. When Richard Feynman first got the call from the Nobel prize committee he hung up, his wife had to talk him into going there and accepting the award. For him, all the reward was in doing physics, not getting some prize from a committee.\n\nIn conclusion, translate dreams into daily actions. Do the daily actions for a week and see how you like it. Think about how the actions and behaviour feel, with no regard for the outcome. If you like them in themselves, you will win no matter what.\n\nThis is incidentally how I know I have to play music for the rest of my life. I can never get enough of sitting down at a piano and learning new things. If I can do that, I feel successful.\n\nThanks for reading Fallible Pianist!

Now, it is a walk in the park for him (But the feat is quite impressive nonetheless). So even though all the people in that rollercoaster ride are having the same (roughly) experience. They experience it in their own way.\n\nA piece of music will be different for different people. For some, it will stir emotions of reminiscence, for others anxiety, and yet others will think the music is sad, boringly so. The value of the music itself cannot be related to what a specific person happens to experience. Then the value would be as random as the weather.\n\n\n3. Good music is interesting, but it is not obvious that it is.\n\nThere is a magical poem about what it means to be a human, written by Thomas Tranströmer. In the end, it goes like this:\n\nSkäms inte för att du är människa, var stolt! Inne i dig öppnar sig valv bakom valv oändligt. Du blir aldrig färdig, och det är som det skall.\n\nIf you don't know Swedish, the experience of beauty in this poem is not available to you. You have to understand the words for the poem to make sense, otherwise, you would just listen to how the word sounds, rather than what they mean.\n\nThe same is true in music. It is not enough to just listen to a piece of music if you want to make a judgment about its value. If you don't know what a sonata form is, then you will miss a valuable part of the musical content of a Beethoven sonata. For instance, in his last sonatas, he takes the sonata form to its limits. In the op 109, he compresses the exposition into just one page of music, something which usually goes on for much longer. Yet it does not give the impression of being short. Without knowing what the sonata form is, that feat will not be recognizable.\n\nSo listening to a piece and deciding if we \"like\" it or not, without deeper understanding than hearing the sounds of the piece, would be like deciding the value of a poem in a language you don't understand. What you are referring to is how the words or the music sounds. But the sounds are only means to an end, in both language and music. The words are used to convey a specific meaning, in music it is not clear what the meaning is, but there is one.\n\nI just touched upon a mystery of its own there, what is meaning in music? For another time.\n\nThanks for reading Fallible Pianist!

Some teacher’s might put little marks on the instrument to show where the fingers should press, but they only need to do that if the student can’t audiate.

It is very interesting and although I have only scratched the surface of it so far, I am convinced it is a useful theory.\n\n\nHow to investigate a theory\n\nTLDR this question cannot be answered in such a way as to allow an automatic process which allows you to mechanically sort good and bad theories, or true or false. Searching for truth is weird, mysterious and always unpredictable. Having said that, the main thing I want to get clear at first when looking at a theory is “what problem does it solve”. We know from Karl Popper that theories are invented to solve a problem, they are not invented to be “true” in the abstract. Finding out what main problem a theory tries to solve has two uses.\n\n 1. You can check if the theory solves a problem you are interested in.\n 2. You can check if the theory solves the problem\n\nNumber 1 is quite self explanatory, but I think it is worth pointing out that it only makes sense to investigate theories which solve problems you are interested in. This is one of the main (and devestating) critique of compulsory schooling. Learning a theory such as Newton’s gravitational laws only make sense if you need that theory for something in your life. Not some vague time in the future but right now. If the theory does not adress some problem you care about, you might memorize the content of the theory, but it will be virtually meaningless for you. Here is the rub, every single individual have a unique set of problems they care about, therefore they should each be allowed to use these problem situations to guide them in life. These problem situations are manifested in particular interests. School starts from the other way around, they assume everyone is the same and should learn the same things. This guarentees that practically everyone will learn things that are meaningless for them.\n\nTheories in education are plagued by the fact that often they deal with the question of how to deal with unmotivated kids who don’t want to learn the thing. Well this is not a question educators should deal with according to me. The field of education starts with someone who *wants* to learn the thing. If they don’t want to, they should not learn it.\n\nOne thing that is interesting about MLT is that it is a theory of learning and not teaching. That is, Edwin Gordon lays out a theory that explains what it means to learn and understand music. Music is weird and mysterious, this question is not obvious! What is the difference between someone who can hear a song, understand how it works and play it on an instrument vs someone for whom the same song might as well be in chinese.\n\nGordon’s core answer is audiation. It is not easy to put my finger on quite what it is, but the basic definition is the ability to think in music. Gordon defines it thus “audiation is to music what thought is to language”. MLT is all about developing the ability to audiate, or rather how does it work when people develop this ability?\n\nLet’s make it very concrete:\n\nImagine someone takes up a violin for the first time and they want to play the song “twinkle twinkle little star”. One problem with playing violin is that the musician needs to intonate on the instrument. The violin itself does not intonate, it is the musician who intonates. The correct intonation is something the musician needs to bring to the instrument, where does it come from? It needs to be based on the musicians ability to hear the tune with the correct pitches in his inner mind. If the musician can audiate, that means he will hear if he plays in tune or not, but if he cannot audiate the instrument will not help him. Some teacher’s might put little marks on the instrument to show where the fingers should press, but they only need to do that if the student can’t audiate. Moreover doing so will make the student able to move their fingers in the correct way to play the tune, but they will not do it based on a musical understanding, but on an understanding of finger movements and their teacher’s corrections.\n\nTo summarize, they will learn to play an instrument without understanding music. This would be like instructing a child how to use their mouth to produce a work like “milk”, proceeding with more and more words until they can form english sentences, entirely without knowing what the sentences mean.

I don’t mean to be mean, although I play quite a lot by ear, especially know that my main focus is on playing jazz music, I do not have very advanced audiation myself, but it is getting better!\n\nSo the basic thing Gordon tried to understand is how a person develops audiation. Knowing the answer, how can we help a student to develop this.\n\nThe whole of his theory is quite complex, and like I said I am just putting together bits and pieces of it so far.

It feels like the first beat of every bar comes in the wrong place and that I need to keep track of it by counting. If I am playing in 4/4 or 3/4, I don’t need to keep track of the one, I feel it. So how can I make a meter like 7/4 feel natural?\n\nThanks for reading Fallible Pianist! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.\n\n\nSolutions\n\n * Every odd meter is made up of groups of 3 or 2.\n * Feeling an odd meter can be simpler by turning a 7/4 into one bar of 4 plus one bar of 3.\n * If you play an odd meter slowly, say 70 bpm the two parts of the bar become easy to maneuver\n * In fast tempos it helps to think in half notes. This turns two bars of 7/4 into one slow bar of 7/4. I will explain this principle more below.\n\n\nFeeling the long beat\n\nThe principle of dividing a 7/4 into a group of 4 + 3 is a great tool. If you want a feel for how this sounds listen to this drum beat. The first half of the bar sounds like a simple rock beat in 4/4 and the 3/4 part is based on dotted quarter notes. This becomes slightly awkward though in fast tempos, which is why it makes sense to feel the half-notes as the main beat instead. Like this:\n\nThis produces the slightly weird effect of turning the downbeats of the second bar into upbeats. Apart from this, this even makes tempos of 300 bpm feel slow.\n\n\nPractice ideas:\n\nA way to practice this is by clapping your hands in half notes and singing a 7/4 riff. One that I particularly love is this by Gael Horellou.\n\nThe claps occur simultaneously as the first two chords in the first bar but between them in the second bar. It makes it even more swinging somehow.\n\nIt makes sense to feel the tempo like this when playing the last movement of Prokofiev’s 7th sonata as well.\n\nAgain this has the effect of turning the two Bb major chords in the second bar into upbeats.\n\n\nPlaying eighths notes\n\nAnother helpful thing is an exercise I picked up from Kenny Werner.

Usually at the ends of A section standards either land on the tonic of the key, which would be F in this case, or it lands on the dominant chord, which would be C7. This song sort of ends on a C major as a tonic chord instead and then it becomes a dominant, but just a bar before the tonality was C minor, very ambiguous and ingenious writing by Vernon Duke. This is just the A section, and as I mentioned the song ends in F minor providing a sort of melancholic afterthought to the song. All this being said, fancy modulations are not difficult to write, just writing some major chords in a random order will do it. What is more interesting is how to make the modulations fit into the larger picture of the song, making it sound natural and organic in the process.

As Ethan Iverson says, the repertoire is essentially where you get the knowledge of playing jazz.

I anticipate that this substack will evolve at the intersection of my interests in philosophy and music. One could be tempted to say it will be about the philosophy of music. While it may touch upon the philosophy of music, I plan to explore a wide range of topics. Hence the music of philosophy, which sounds nice in my ears but does not mean anything. Which is in a sense a description of music itself.\n\nSome things that will be discussed in future posts are:\n\n * Why AI’s cannot be used to make “tailor-made art for individual preferences”.\n * Why pianists frequently misunderstand Thelonious Monk and why the mistake is similar to treating people as means instead of ends.\n * How I go about composing music and what I am trying to achieve.\n\nSubscribe now","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2023-06-17T13:53:14.000Z","updated_at":"2024-08-09T10:37:06.000Z","published_at":"2023-06-17T13:53:14.000Z","custom_excerpt":"The music of philosophy","codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":null,"show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"66b5f0d0905e410001df7348","uuid":"5f59478e-1da5-4acc-b380-2a99953041cf","title":"how-to-use-the-substack-editor","slug":"how-to-use-the-substack-editor-66b5f0cfcc4e8e001b1631fc","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"image\",{\"src\":\"__GHOST_URL__/content/images/2024/08/https-3a-2f-2fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2ffec21723-9bb2-4ea6-8fc2-09d17ba3bd1a_4032x3024.jpg\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/941694455853101056\",\"html\":\"<blockquote class=\\\"twitter-tweet\\\"><p lang=\\\"en\\\" dir=\\\"ltr\\\">Twitter is an amazing tool and an awful place.</p> — Hamish McKenzie (@hamishmckenzie) <a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/941694455853101056\\\"> 3:40 PM ∙ Dec 15, 2017 </a><a href=\\\"https://twitter.com/hamishmckenzie/status/941694455853101056\\\"></a></blockquote><script async=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\\\" charset=\\\"utf-8\\\"></script>\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZoEUu1XHL7U?rel=0&autoplay=0&showinfo=0&enablejsapi=0\",\"html\":\"<iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZoEUu1XHL7U?rel=0&amp;autoplay=0&amp;showinfo=0&amp;enablejsapi=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\" gesture=\\\"media\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; fullscreen\\\" allowautoplay=\\\"true\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" width=\\\"728\\\" height=\\\"409\\\"></iframe>\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/288003645?autoplay=0\",\"html\":\"<iframe src=\\\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/288003645?autoplay=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" gesture=\\\"media\\\" allow=\\\"autoplay; fullscreen\\\" allowautoplay=\\\"true\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"true\\\" loading=\\\"lazy\\\"></iframe>\"}],[\"embed\",{\"url\":\"https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/4eLPsYPBmXABThSJ821sqY\",\"html\":\"<iframe class=\\\"spotify-wrap album\\\" data-attrs=\\\"{&quot;image&quot;:&quot;https://i.scdn.co/image/4988546859334f9a5a3fa4acedc5aea275929026&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;LOVE.

I would guess that my improvisation might have some mistakes but it also could be more daring. When I listen to something I have improvised sometimes I can't see where some of the music comes from. That is an interesting thing in itself. I don't think I could have written some of the things I have improvised, the things I write is more structured and less daring.\n\nOnce I played melodica on the song Oblivion with a string orchestra, and listening back to that, I realize that if I had written a set of variations on that theme, I would not have written what I play there. Something of the charm with improvisation is that it allows us to tap into parts of ourselves that are unconscious, and therefore a bit mysterious.\n\n\n\n\nRecommended recording\n\nTried to help my daughter sleep using this sublime lied by Schumann\n\nIt is just incredible. Check it out with the poem as well, the music sounds as if it stands still, and the poem describes a knight who has been still for hundreds of years in a castle. The whole poem is a frozen picture to me, and it is astounding how Schumann can use such a temporal art form as music to convey something that does not move.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","email_recipient_filter":"all","created_at":"2024-09-23T09:20:06.000Z","updated_at":"2024-09-30T08:22:14.000Z","published_at":"2024-09-30T08:18:21.000Z","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null,"newsletter_id":"65f1cb1a1f996c0008bccca6","show_title_and_feature_image":1},{"id":"670e24e76382fa00011a7bd6","uuid":"24343a1c-cd75-4201-a2ba-93d43129fa5f","title":"Rhythm without counting","slug":"rhythm-without-counting","mobiledoc":null,"lexical":"{\"root\":{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"Counting is confusing\",\"type\":\"extended-text\",\"version\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"listitem\",\"version\":1,\"value\":1}],\"direction\":\"ltr\",\"format\":\"\",\"indent\":0,\"type\":\"list\",\"version\":1,\"listType\":\"bullet\",\"start\":1,\"tag\":\"ul\"},{\"children\":[{\"detail\":0,\"format\":0,\"mode\":\"normal\",\"style\":\"\",\"text\":\"When I was young(er) I remember an event from school.

The blender method achieves the same emulsion as the whisking, but it is faster and more fool-proof. A traditional chef might have thought that the only way to make mayo is to master the art of creating an emulsion by whisking carefully with a hand. But really examining how an emulsion work might make us come up with a new way of making mayo. That is Kenjis basic approach and what is noteworthy is that often his recipes does not change the tradition so much, and then he keeps doing it that way. His skeptical approach is not dogmatic. It is not something like \\\"end all tradition\\\". It is rather \\\"why this tradition, how does it work?\\\" If it turns out that the traditional way is good, why do it differently.
