                <p>I am a pianist, piano teacher and composer living in Sweden, mostly focused on jazz and classical music. I love the realm of ideas. One of my core beliefs is that the good life is lived in the world of ideas.</p>
<p>Some of my favourite artists have a striking individuality without resorting to a cliche of originality. Notable examples are Thelonious Monk, Lester Young, Bela Bartok, and Tom Waits. That is an ideal I am striving towards with my own music.</p>
<p>I am interested in music pedagogy and love finding ways of explaining the musical language to children. Though explaining is stretching the meaning of the word a bit because explaining music usually consists of singing and dancing rather than using words.</p>
