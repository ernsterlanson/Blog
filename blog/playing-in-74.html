                <h3>Basic problem</h3>
<p>Playing in compound meters feels odd to me. It feels like the first beat of every bar comes in the wrong place and that I need to keep track of it by counting. If I am playing in 4/4 or 3/4, I don’t need to keep track of the one, I feel it. So how can I make a meter like 7/4 feel natural?</p>

<h3>Solutions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every odd meter is made up of groups of 3 or 2.</li>
<li>Feeling an odd meter can be simpler by turning a 7/4 into one bar of 4 plus one bar of 3.</li>
<li>If you play an odd meter slowly, say 70 bpm the two parts of the bar become easy to maneuver</li>
<li>In fast tempos it helps to think in half notes. This turns two bars of 7/4 into one slow bar of 7/4. I will explain this principle more below.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Feeling the long beat</h3>
<p>The principle of dividing a 7/4 into a group of 4 + 3 is a great tool. If you want a feel for how this sounds listen to this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIv5UTHzszU&t=19s&ab_channel=JonFoster">drum beat</a>. The first half of the bar sounds like a simple rock beat in 4/4 and the 3/4 part is based on dotted quarter notes. This becomes slightly awkward though in fast tempos, which is why it makes sense to feel the half-notes as the main beat instead. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2fcf7742e4-4e3a-4444-80c4-94f4ffd40c3a_740x168.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This produces the slightly weird effect of turning the downbeats of the second bar into upbeats. Apart from this, this even makes tempos of 300 bpm feel slow.</p>
<h3>Practice ideas:</h3>
<p>A way to practice this is by clapping your hands in half notes and singing a 7/4 riff. One that I particularly love is this by <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1wNujd6NfLbhwSwKLWsePL?si=af7c72ec5bc4422d">Gael Horellou</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f8fc3d952-f89b-4d35-bae7-8c3168d01451_1918x252.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The claps occur simultaneously as the first two chords in the first bar but between them in the second bar. It makes it even more swinging somehow.</p>
<p>It makes sense to feel the tempo like this when playing the last movement of Prokofiev’s 7th sonata as well.</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f76a24a00-9d48-4091-a313-cca6f1e02506_1070x536-png.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Again this has the effect of turning the two Bb major chords in the second bar into upbeats.</p>
<h3>Playing eighths notes</h3>
<p>Another helpful thing is an exercise I picked up from Kenny Werner. The idea is to fill up a bar of 7/4 with eighth notes and then remove them in various ways. The first way consists of removing just one eighth note and shifting that space around. Like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/https-3a-2f-2fsubstack-post-media-s3-amazonaws-com-2fpublic-2fimages-2f9d9d8f0a-ebcd-4c5a-96bf-93bfd0189871_1128x575.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The exercise is done in four-bar phrases, to add the bonus of cementing the feeling of four-bars. Of course, this can be varied in countless ways. You can remove more than one eighth note, and displace the whole group of eighth notes to other parts of the beat.</p>
<p>With this things are improving. Problems are soluble, it is good to remember to be happy when we encounter something we can’t do, for that means we have a clear path towards progress.</p>
