                <p>The Jazz pianist and educator Jeremy Siskind has an exersice called &quot;dream solo&quot;. The idea is that you try to write out a solo on a jazz tune, to get a chance to really think about what notes you put in there and allow for more thorough error-correction. Calling it &quot;dream solo&quot; because the ability to write it out slowly means you can create a better solo than the one you just make up on the spot.</p>
<p>I prefer to call it &quot;composed solo&quot;, just to emphasize that the point is to think about the construction slowly and carefully. Will it be your dream solo? who knows!</p>
<p>Anyway, the exercise is useful and here I did it on the tune &quot;What&#39;s New&quot;. My main focus was to create a solo using &quot;bebop-language&quot;.</p>
<p>Here is the complete chorus:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.40.09.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to analyze it and discuss what I learned from doing it. First, let&#39;s check some bars where I deleted my first ideas and my reason for it.</p>
<h3>Lessons from correction</h3>
<ol>
<li>Going back and forth between the same notes.</li>
</ol>
<p>In same cases I created a line like this:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.42.18-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This was the original line on bar 4. I changed it to this</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.43.19.png" alt=""></p>
<p>The difference being that in the deleted bar I went back and forth between the notes D and Eb flat. That sounds boring! To add a little more colour I just changed the D to a Db flat, using notes from the Altered Scale in G. This came up in other places.</p>
<p>This line:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.46.16.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Changed to:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.52.02-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Again, the going back and forth between B and A sounded off to me.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Rhythmic interest</li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to write a long passage of eighth notes starting in bar 8. Yet in the ending of the phrase it didn&#39;t really climax, I think I solved it by using triplets in the ending of the phrase. So this bar:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.54.38.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Became:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.55.44-1.png" alt=""></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>More angular phrases</li>
</ol>
<p>In bar 11 I changed:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.57.28-1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To:</p>
<p><img src="/static/images/blog/Screenshot-2024-09-23-at-11.57.59.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This added some more variation to the phrase, some angularity making it a bit less predictable.</p>
<h3>Incorporating Sonny&#39;s rhythmic asymmetry</h3>
<p>I recently transcribed and analyzed Sonny Rollin&#39;s solo on <a href="__GHOST_URL__/2-min-of-genius/">Strode Rode</a>. One interesting aspect was his assymetric phrases that go over the barline. In bars 20 to 23 I incorporated some of that. That is in general a way to get more out of your transcriptions. You take something that you liked and work to include it in an exercise.</p>
<p>Here those phrases are isolated.</p>

<h3>Parting thoughts</h3>
<p>I haven&#39;t done this exercise a lot, and will do it more in the future. I will probably update this post as well with a recording of the solo and a recording of one that is improvised on the spot. That could be a fun thing to do. I would guess that my improvisation might have some mistakes but it also could be more daring. When I listen to something I have improvised sometimes I can&#39;t see where some of the music comes from. That is an interesting thing in itself. I don&#39;t think I could have written some of the things I have improvised, the things I write is more structured and less daring.  </p>
<p>Once I played melodica on the song Oblivion with a string orchestra, and listening back to that, I realize that if I had written a set of variations on that theme, I would not have written what I play there. Something of the charm with improvisation is that it allows us to tap into parts of ourselves that are unconscious, and therefore a bit mysterious.</p>
<h3>Recommended recording</h3>
<p>Tried to help my daughter sleep using this sublime lied by Schumann</p>
<p>It is just incredible. Check it out with the poem as well, the music sounds as if it stands still, and the poem describes a knight who has been still for hundreds of years in a castle. The whole poem is a frozen picture to me, and it is astounding how Schumann can use such a temporal art form as music to convey something that does not move.</p>
