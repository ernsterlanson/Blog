                <p>Welcome, I am Ernst Erlanson, a fallible pianist living in Sweden. Fallible? Yes, one of my favorite words in English. It contains the seeds of the theory of epistemology known as Critical Rationalism. It is a condition that we all find ourselves in, people are fallible and at the same time the most fantastic entity in the universe. So, being a person, I too am fallible. However, I don&#39;t mean to degrade people or myself in saying this. Humans have the capacity to create explanatory knowledge, which is the most powerful force in the universe. We can transform the whole of existence within the limits of the laws of nature. If this entails controlling entire galaxies in the future, then humanity has the potential to achieve it. This means that both you and I possess the same potential.</p>
<p>As for the second part, I am a pianist, and most of my days are spent dealing with music in some way. I anticipate that this substack will evolve at the intersection of my interests in philosophy and music. One could be tempted to say it will be about the philosophy of music. While it may touch upon the philosophy of music, I plan to explore a wide range of topics. Hence the music of philosophy, which sounds nice in my ears but does not mean anything. Which is in a sense a description of music itself.</p>
<p>Some things that will be discussed in future posts are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why AI’s cannot be used to make “tailor-made art for individual preferences”.</li>
<li>Why pianists frequently misunderstand Thelonious Monk and why the mistake is similar to treating people as means instead of ends.</li>
<li>How I go about composing music and what I am trying to achieve.</li>
</ul>
